This article is a survey of results on projective configurations of subspaces in
general position. It is written in the form of introduction to the subject, with
much of the material accessible to advanced high school students. However, in
the part of the survey concerning configurations of lines in general position in
three-dimensional space we give a detailed exposition. </div></div>

article in "Kvant" was titled <span class="FontItalic" > Interlacing of Skew
Lines </span>
. This title sounds a little strange, doesn't it? The word "interlacing" suggests
something flexible, not straight lines! To be sure, the title refers not to be the
process of interlacing, but rather to the result. But is it possible to weave
together skew lines which are situated in some clever way with respect to one
another? At first glance this may seem not to be possible. Yet where do we
get this impression? In daily life we never come across anything that really
resembles a straight line. What bothers us is not that there is not such thing
as an infinitely thin object&mdash;we are prepared to neglect the
thickness&mdash;but rather that there is no such thing as an infinitely long
object. Even light rays&mdash;which are models of linearity&mdash;become
scattered and dispersed, and cannot be detected at a large distance. In
practice one deals only with line segments. </p>
    <p> Any set of disjoint line segments can be moved around to any other
relative location in such a way that they remain disjoint. This we can see from
experience, and it is also not hard to prove. We depict straight lines using line
segments, and so it seems to us that straight lines cannot be woven together.
But is that really the case? </p>
    <p> First of all, let us give a more precise statement of the questions which
concern us. The first question is: Can a set of disjoint lines be rearranged? But
what do we mean by the term "rearrange"? Here we shall not be concerned
with the angles or distances between the lines. We shall consider the relative
position of the lines to be unchanged if we move them in such a way that they
never touch. But if one set of lines cannot be obtained from another set by such
a movement, then we shall say that the two sets of lines are arranged differently.
</p>
    <p> The simplest lines for us to visualize are parallel lines. Clearly, any two
sets of parallel lines with the same number of lines in each set have the same
arrangement. In fact, if we consider the lines of one set to be "frozen" in place
and then rotate the entire space, we can make them parallel to the lines of the
other set; then, moving the lines of the first set one by one in such a way that
they remain parallel and do not bump into one another, we can easily make
them coincide with the lines of the second set. </p>
    <p> We now consider arbitrary sets of lines. Can an arbitrary set of lines
be moved ("combed") into a set of parallel lines? This question has a simple
and unexpected answer, which is hard to arrive at by considering concrete sets
of lines. If you take a specific set of lines and study it for a while, you can
probably find a way to make all of the lines parallel. But this does not give an


answer to the question in full generality, because you undoubtedly made use of
some specific features of your set of lines. Can one treat all possible sets of lines
at once? It turns out that one can, and this is how. Let us take an arbitrary
set of disjoint lines. We choose two parallel planes which are not parallel to any
of the lines in our set. We fix the points of intersection of the first plane with
the lines, fastening the lines at those points. We also fix the intersection of the
lines with the second plane, but only as a point on that plane, which we allow
to slide along the lines. In other words, we drill small holes in the second plane
where it intersects with the lines. We then move the second plane away from
the first one in the direction perpendicular to both planes. The lines are pulled
through the little holes, and the angles which they form with the planes increase.
If we move the second plane to infinity in a finite amount of time, then these
angles all reach $ 90^\circ$, i.e., the lines become parallel to one another. This
"combing" of our set of lines can be described as follows in a language which is
more customary for geometry: we expand the space away from the first plane
in a direction perpendicular to it, where the expansion factor increases rapidly
to infinity in a finite length of time. Here the straight lines rotate around their
points of intersection with the plane, and in the limit they become perpendicular
to the plane. </p>
    <p> Thus, one cannot have interlaced disjoint lines: all sets of disjoint lines
have the same arrangement. But our title refers to skew lines, and so sets of
parallel lines are excluded. There is a serious reason for this. Parallel lines are
very close to being intersecting lines: one can move one of two parallel lines by
an arbitrarily small amount so as to make them intersect. This is not the case
for skew lines. </p>
    <p> Since we have decided not to allow parallel lines, we must reexamine
the question of which sets of lines have the same arrangement and which do
not. We shall say that the arrangement of a set of lines remains the same if
it is moved in such a way that the lines are always skew, never parallel. In
what follows we will often be considering such movements of lines, and so it is
useful to have a special word to refer to them. We shall use the word <span
class="emph" > isotopy </span>
to denote such a movement of lines. If one set of lines cannot be obtained from
another by means of an isotopy, then we say that the two sets have different
arrangements. We shall also say that such sets of lines are nonisotopic. </p>
    <p> The amount of difficulty in determining whether two sets of lines are
isotopic depends most of all on the number of lines in the sets. In general, the
more lines, the more clever one must be to find an isotopy which transforms one
set into the other. We first treat the simplest case of the isotopy problem.

id="bOdYS3"; class="bOdY hide"> We take any two pairs of skew lines,
and try to decide whether they are isotopic. In this case it is perhaps too
pretentious to use the word "problem", because it is completely obvious that
we have an isotopy. Nevertheless, we shall make a detailed examination of the
proof. </p>
    <p> Using a rotation around a line which is perpendicular to both lines in
one of the pairs, we can make the angle between the lines the same in both
pairs; in fact, we can make both angles $ 90^\circ$. We note that the smallest
line segment joining the two lines in a pair is the segment of the common
perpendicular which is contained between them. We next bring the two lines
closer together (or move them farther apart) along this perpendicular, so that
the segments have the same length for the two pairs; after that we move one
pair so that the segment between the two lines coincides with the segment for
the other pair. We use a rotation around this segment to make one of the lines
of the first pair coincide with a line of the second pair (this can be done
because all of the lines are perpendicular to the segment). In the process the
second lines of the pairs also come together. In fact, they both pass through a
common point&mdash;an endpoint of the perpendicular segment&mdash;and
are perpendicular to the same plane&mdash;the plane determined by the
perpendicular and the first lines of the pairs (which now coincide). The proof
is complete. </p>
    <p> At the end of the proof, after we made the distances between the two
lines the same for the two pairs, we moved a pair of lines in a rigid
manner&mdash;without changing either the distance or the angle between
them. The question arises: Suppose that both the distances and angles
between the two lines are the same for two pairs of skew lines. Is it always
possible to find an isotopy between the two pairs during which the distance
and angle remain fixed? The previous argument shows that this question has
an affirmative answer if the angle is $ 90^\circ$. However, if the angle is not
$ 90^\circ$, then it may happen that after the isotopy in the previous
paragraph the second lines in the pairs do not coincide. This unlucky case is
illustrated in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f1')"
class="cp2recto">1</span>. The second lines in the pairs form an angle
whose bisector is parallel to the first (skew) lines, and the plane containing the
second lines is perpendicular to the plane containing the bisector and the first
lines. Thus, there was a good reason why we wanted to make the angles
$ 90^\circ$ in the beginning of the above proof: for any other choice of the
angle, the construction would not give the desired result. But this was not
simply an artifact of our particular construction; it turns out that any two
pairs of skew lines with equal distance and angle which do not coincide after
the above construction cannot be made to coincide using any isotopy during
which the distance and angle remain fixed. This is connected with a
remarkable phenomenon, which we shall encounter often in the sequel. It
merits a more detailed discussion.

   <p> To orient a set of lines means to give a direction to each line in the
set. There are $ 2^n$ possible orientations of a set of $ n$ lines. A
<span class="emph" > semi-orientation </span>
of a set of lines is a pair of opposite orientations (Figure <span

A semi - orientation of a pair of lines..</div> </div> </div> </p>
   <p> Any pair of nonperpendicular lines has a canonical semi-orientation
which is determined by the relative position of the two lines. Namely, we
choose an arbitrary orientation of one of the lines, and then we determine the
orientation of the second line by rotating the first line in the most economical
way (i.e., with the smallest angle of rotation) so as to make it parallel to the
second line (see Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f3')"
class="cp2recto">3</span>). We then give the second line the orientation
pointing in the same direction as the (now parallel) first line. Thus, choosing
an orientation of one of the lines determines an orientation of the pair. If we
choose the opposite orientation of the first line, then we obtain the opposite
orientation of the pair. If we were to use the other line to start with, we would
obtain the same pair of opposite orientations. These two opposite orientations
are what we meant by the canonical semi-orientation of the pair of
nonperpendicular lines.

   <p> An isotropy during which the angle between the lines remains fixed
takes the canonical semi-orientation to the canonical semi-orientation. This
suggests the idea of considering another type of isotopy&mdash;isotopies of
semi-oriented pairs of skew lines. Here we allow the angle and distance
between the lines to change, but we require that the semi-orientation be
preserved. Such an isotopy occupies an intermediate position between an


arbitrary isotopy and an isotopy during which the distance and angle (where
we suppose that the angle is $ \not=90^\circ$) remain fixed. That is, if there is no
semi-oriented isotopy between two semi-oriented pairs of lines, then there is
certainly no isotopy between them which preserves the distance and angle.
What can stand in the way of an isotopy of semi-oriented pairs of lines?

</p>
   <p> Any semi-oriented pair of lines has a characteristic which takes the
value $ +1$ or $ -1$. It is called the <span class="emph" >
linking number </span>
. This number is preserved under isotopies, and so if two semi-oriented pairs
of lines have different linking numbers, then they are not isotopic. Here is
the definition of the linking number. The most economical way of aligning
an oriented line with a second oriented line which is skew to it is to place it
alongside a common perpendicular to the two lines and then rotate it by the
smallest angle that brings it to the same direction as the second line. Here
the line rotates either like the right hand around the thumb, or like the left
hand (Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f5')" class="cp2recto">4</span>).
In the first case the linking number is $ -1$, and in the second case it is
$ +1$.

<div class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;4</span>
.</div> </div> </div> </p>
   <p> To help the reader familiar with algebraic topology make the right
connection, we give a second equivalent definition of the linking number of a
pair of oriented skew lines. Through one of the lines we draw a plane which
intersects the other line. We place our right hand so that our thumb rests on
the second line and passes through the plane in the direction determined by
the orientation of the line, while rotating in the direction our fingers point. On
the plane we obtain an oriented circle which is traced by the tips of our
fingers. The orientation of the circle may be the same as the orientation of the
first line (on the left hand side of Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f6')"
class="cp2recto">5</span>) or different (on the right hand side). In the first
case the linking number is $ +1$, and in the second case it is
$ -1$. <div id="f6" class="container"> <div id="fig5"

   Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f8')" class="cp2recto">6</span> will
enable the reader to see that the two definitions of the linking number are
equivalent.

<span class="graphics"><img src="imagesSkewlines/x8.png"></span>
<div class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;6</span>
.</div> </div> </div> </p>
   <p> It is clear that changing the orientation of one of the lines of the pair
changes the linking number. Hence, if the orientation of the pair is changed to
the opposite orientation (i.e., the orientation is reversed on both lines), then
the linking number does not change. In other words, the linking number is an
invariant of a semi-oriented pair: it depends only on the semi-orientation. If
we look at the reflection of our pair of oriented lines in the mirror (Figure
<span onclick="Cp2Recto('f9')" class="cp2recto">7</span>), the linking
number changes. <div id="f9" class="container"> <div id="fig7"
class="figure"> <span class="graphics"><img
src="imagesSkewlines/x9.png"></span> <div class="caption"> <span
class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;7</span> .</div> </div> </div>
</p>
   <p> We now return to the unfortunate situation we encountered when
looking for an isotopy between two pairs of skew lines which preserves the
distance and angle between the lines (see Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f10')" class="cp2recto">8</span>). At the time we
could not <div id="f10" class="container"> <div id="fig8" class="figure">
<span class="graphics"><img src="imagesSkewlines/x10.png"></span>
<div class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;8</span>
.</div> </div> </div> answer the question of whether the sets are isotopic
(Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f11')" class="cp2recto">9</span>).
Now, however, we see that these pairs (with their canonical semi-orientation)
are obtained from one another by a mirror reflection, and so they have
different linking numbers. Thus, they cannot be connected by an isotopy
which preserves the distance and angle between the lines. But if two pairs
have the same distance and angle and also the same linking number, then they
can be connected by such an isotopy. <div id="f11" class="container"> <div
id="fig9" class="figure"> <span class="graphics"><img
src="imagesSkewlines/x11.png"></span> <div class="caption"> <span
class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;9</span> .</div> </div> </div>
</p>
   <p> By the way, it is possible to modify the notion of the angle between
two skew lines in such a way as to incorporate the linking number and thereby
make it unnecessary to work with the linking number separately. The angle
between two lines was defined above so as to be in the interval $ (0^\circ,90^\circ)$.
define the modified angle between two lines to be the product of the angle in the
earlier sense and the linking number, if the latter is defined (i.e., if the angle is
not $ 90^\circ$), and to be the angle in the earlier sense (i.e., $ 90^\circ$) if


the linking number is not defined. The modified angle is in one of the intervals
$ (-90^\circ,0^\circ)$, $ (0^\circ,+90^\circ]$. The sign can be determined from the right hand
rule, without saying anything about the linking number. </p>
    <p> We have thereby completely analyzed the situation with sets of two
skew lines.

    <p> When we studied pairs of lines, an important role was played by the
common perpendicular to the two skew lines. Strictly speaking, we could have
avoided using it; but it seemed to be connected to the lines in such a natural
way, providing a tangible tie between them, that it would have been strange not
to make use of it. Now it would be good to find something equally natural for a
triple of skew lines. There are two objects that are capable of playing this role.
We shall discuss one of them now, and postpone consideration of the second
one. Jumping ahead, suffice it to say that the second object is a hyperboloid.
</p>
    <p> These objects will not be associated to every triple of pairwise skew
lines. We will have to disallow triples whose lines lie in three parallel planes.
But notice that such an arrangement is unstable: by nudging one of the lines
a little, we obtain an isotopic triple to which our constructions can be applied.
</p>
    <p> Thus, we consider an arbitrary triple of pairwise skew lines which do
not lie in three parallel planes. For each line we draw two planes containing
the line, each parallel to one of the other two lines. In this way we obtain six
planes, i.e., three pairs of parallel planes. These planes intersect to form a
parallelepiped. Our lines are the extensions of three of its skew edges (Figure
<span onclick="Cp2Recto('f12')" class="cp2recto">10</span>). Thus, any
three pair-wise skew lines which do not lie in three parallel planes are
extensions of the edges of a certain parallelepiped. This parallelepiped is the
first object which we associate to the triple of lines. What is special about it?
In the first place, it is unique. In fact, there is a unique plane parallel to a
given line that contains a second skew line; and if these lines are the
extensions of edges of a parallelepiped, then this plane contains one of its
faces. Consequently, the six planes are uniquely determined by the original
triple of lines; since any parallelepiped whose edges lie on these lines is
bounded by those planes, it is also uniquely determined. <div id="f12"

.</div> </div> </div> </p>
   <p> We see that the parallelepiped joins together the lines of the triple just
as nicely as the common perpendicular joined together the lines of the pair.
Just as in the case of the common perpendicular and the semi-oriented pair
of nonperpendicular lines, the original geometry of the configuration naturally
leads to something more, though still something which is connected with it in
a canonical way and so merits our further consideration when we study the
original object.
   <span class="FontBold" > A riddle </span>
In Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f13')" class="cp2recto">11</span>,
despite what was proven above, we have drawn two different parallelepipeds
with edges lying on three pairwise skew lines. What is going on?
   <div id="f13" class="container"> <div id="fig11" class="figure">
<span class="graphics"><img src="imagesSkewlines/x13.png"></span>
<div class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;11</span>
.</div> </div> </div> </p>
   <p> We now look at the classification of triples up to isotopy. As shown
above, we may suppose that the lines in the triple are extensions of edges of a
certain parallelepiped. A parallelepiped is determined (up to translation) by
the lengths of its edges and the angles between them. Using a continuous
deformation, we can first make all of the angles into right angles (obtaining a
rectangular parallelepiped), and then we can make all of the edges have the
same length, for example, length one (obtaining a cube) (Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f14')" class="cp2recto">12</span>). This deformation
induces an isotopy of the triple of lines which are extensions of edges of the
parallelepiped. In this way we have managed to place the lines of our triple
along pairwise skew edges of a unit cube. This is a remarkable
accomplishment. It means that we now know that there are not very many
possible nonisotopic sets of three skew lines&mdash;there are at most the
number of triples of skew edges on a cube, and this number is 8. And even 8 is
too many. We can use a rotation of the cube to take any edge of the cube to
any other edge, and this reduces the number of possible nonisotopic
configuration types to two. They are shown in Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f15')" class="cp2recto">13</span>.

<div class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;13</span>
.</div> </div> </div> </p>
   <p> This success might prompt us to hope that we can similarly find an
isotopy between the two triples of lines in Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f15')" class="cp2recto">13</span>, and thereby prove


that all triples of skew lines are isotopic. Try to do this! </p>
   <p> You're having trouble? Don't blame yourself&mdash;it cannot be
done! Just like pairs of oriented lines, triples of (nonoriented) lines have an
invariant, also called the <span class="emph" > linking number </span>
, which takes the value $ +1$ or $ -1$, is preserved under
isotopies, and changes when one takes a mirror reflection of the triple of lines.
Here is its definition. Suppose we have a set of three pairwise skew lines. We
orient the tree lines in an arbitrary way. Then each pair of lines in the triple
has a linking number (equal to $ \pm 1$). If we multiply all of the linking
numbers, we obtain a number (also $ \pm1$), which is what we call the
linking number of the original triple of lines. This number does not depend on
the orientation of the lines, since if we reverse the orientation of any line, the
effect is to change the linking numbers of two of the pairs, and this does not
change the product. The fact that the linking number of a triple is preserved
under isotopy and changes under mirror reflection follows from the
corresponding properties of the linking numbers of pairs of oriented lines.
Since the triples of lines in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f15')"
class="cp2recto">13</span> are the mirror images of one another, they have
different linking numbers, and hence they are not isotopic to one another.
</p>
   <p> Since any triple of pairwise skew lines is isotopic to one of the two triples
in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f15')" class="cp2recto">13</span>, it
follows that two triples of lines are isotopic if and only if they have the same
linking number. </p>
   <p> Thus, as soon as we reach three lines we find that there are different
possible arrangements of triples of skew lines. This provides a justification for
the title of the paper, and for our subsequent use of the word <span
class="emph" > interlacing </span>
for a set of pairwise skew lines.
   <p> <span class="FontBold" > Problem. </span>
It is natural to expect that <span class="emph" > the linking number of
a triple of nonoriented lines is equal to the linking number of some pair of
semi-oriented lines which can be constructed from the triple in a canonical way.
</span>
This is in fact the case, except that rather than one such semi-oriented pair
there are three. Prove that for any triple of skew lines there is a unique semi-
orientation such that the linking numbers of all three pairs of lines in the triple
are equal. Obviously, this value is also equal to the linking number of the triple.

   <p> Note that a triple of skew lines is never isotopic to its mirror image,
while a pair of lines is isotopic to its mirror image. In general, we say that a
set of pairwise skew lines is <span class="emph" > amphicheiral </span>
if it is isotopic to its mirror image; otherwise we say it is <span
class="emph" > nonamphicheiral. </span>
Thus, a triple is always nonamphicheiral, and a pair is amphicheiral. The
following questions arise: </p>
   <p> 1) Are there other values of $ p$ such that any interlacing of
$ p$ lines is nonamphicheiral? </p>
   <p> 2) Are there other values of $ p$ such that any interlacing of
$ p$ lines is amphicheiral? </p>
   <p> 3) For what $ p$ does there exist a nonamphicheiral
interlacing of $ p$ lines? 4) For what $ p$ does there exist an
amphicheiral interlacing of $ p$ lines? Although this does not take us
very far in the direction of an answer to our original question (of describing
the set of interlacings of $ p$ lines up to isotopy), it is worthwhile to
take up these four questions. They are rough and somewhat superficial
questions, but at the same time they have a more qualitative character.
Because of this roughness and superficiality we can be confident of early
success, and the result will undoubtedly be useful in our classification. </p>
   <p> We do not yet have at our disposal very many tools for proving that a
set is nonamphicheiral. But we do know that every triple is nonamphicheiral,
and this is already a lot. After all, any set of more than three lines contains
triples. Each triple changes its linking number in the course of a mirror
reflection. Thus, if the interlacing is amphicheiral, then it must have the same
number of triples with linking number $ +1$ as with linking number
$ -1$. In particular, the total number of triples in the interlacing must
be even. This simple argument leads us to the following unexpected result.

   <p> Theorem <span onclick="Cp2Recto('th1')"

four questions above. The second question has a negative answer: for any
$ p\ge3$ one can construct a nonamphicheiral interlacing of $ p$


lines. This also answers question 3). The simplest nonamphicheiral
interlacings are shown in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f16')"
class="cp2recto">14</span> for $ p=4,5$, and 6. It is easy to continue
with this sequence of examples. All of the triples of lines in the interlacings in
this sequence have the same linking number, and for this reason we know that
the interlacings are nonamphicheiral.

    <p> It remains to answer Question 4). We do not yet know whether or not
there are amphicheiral interlacings of $ p$ lines when $ p\not\equiv 3\mod4$. It
is convenient to consider separately the two cases: $ p$ even, and
$ p\equiv1 \mod4$, although in both cases the question turns out to have a positive
answer. In Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f18')"
class="cp2recto">15</span> (in which $ p=4$) we show the simplest
example of an amphicheiral interlacing of $ p$ lines with $ p$
even. For any even number $ p$, we take two sets of $ p/2$
lines, one behind the other. The lines of the set nearest us are taken from the
sequence of nonamphicheiral interlacings constructed above (see Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f16')" class="cp2recto">14</span>). The other set of
$ p/2$ lines is obtained from the first by rotating and then reflecting in
a mirror. How do we see that the interlacing on the left hand side in Figure
<span onclick="Cp2Recto('f18')" class="cp2recto">15</span> is
amphicheiral? We move the couple of uppermost lines in such a way that the
part of its projection which contains all of the intersections (in the projection)
passes over and above the projection of the other set. If we then rotate the
resulting picture by $ 90^\circ$ clockwise, we obtain the mirror image of the
original interlacing.

</div> </div> </p>
    <p> We now turn to the case $ p\equiv 1 \mod4$, i.e., $ p=4k+1$. An
amphicheiral interlacing with $ k=1$ is shown in Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f19')" class="cp2recto">16</span>. Four of the lines
form two pairs which are situated as in the amphicheiral interlacing of four
lines constructed above. The fifth line is placed so as to separate the two lines
in each pair. <div id="f19" class="container"> <div id="fig16"

    <p> An isotopy between this interlacing and its mirror image can be
constructed as follows. We rotate the lines of the pair nearest us around the
fifth line by almost $ 180^\circ$&mdash;until the lines of the other pair are in
the way (Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f20')"
class="cp2recto">17</span>). <div id="f20" class="container"> <div

class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;17</span> .</div> </div> </div>
</p>
    <p> We then move the fifth line so that its projection passes to the other
side of the intersection (in the projection) of the lines that we moved before
(Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f21')" class="cp2recto">18</span>).
<div id="f21" class="container"> <div id="fig18" class="figure"> <span

class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;18</span>
.</div> </div> </div> </p>
    <p> It remains simply to look at the resulting interlacing from the
opposite side. We do this by rotating it by $ 180^\circ$ around a vertical line
(Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f22')" class="cp2recto">19</span>).
Now we see that we have the mirror image of the original interlacing. <div
id="f22" class="container"> <div id="fig19" class="figure"> <span
class="graphics"><img src="imagesSkewlines/x22.png"></span> <div
class="caption"> <span class="TagCaption">Figure&nbsp;19</span>
.</div> </div> </div> </p>
    <p> Using this example, it is easy to manufacture amphicheiral
interlacings of $ 4k+1$ lines for $ k&gt; 1$. Each line in Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f19')" class="cp2recto">16</span> except for the fifth
is replaced by an interlacing of $ k$ lines which either is taken from
the sequence in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f16')"
class="cp2recto">14</span> or else is the mirror reflection of an interlacing
in that sequence. This must be done in such a way that the interlacings which
replace the lines of one of the pairs form an interlacing of the same type.
There is no work needed to prove that the final result is an amphicheiral
interlacing, since the required isotopy can be obtained in the obvious way from
the one in the previous paragraph.

    <p> At this point we have actually already encountered all of the types of
interlacings of four lines. There are three of them, and they are depicted in
Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')" class="cp2recto">20</span>. The


interlacing in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f16')"

and the interlacing in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f17')"

these three sets are not isotopic to one another: the first one is not
amphicheiral, and so is not isotopic to the second one, and the third one is
amphicheiral, and so is not isotopic to either the first or the second. <div

Interlacings of 4 lines..</div> </div> </div> </p>
    <p> In order to show that any interlacing of four lines is isotopic to one of
the interlacings in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')"
class="cp2recto">20</span>, we shall have to make use of the second of the
two objects which, as mentioned above, are associated to a triple of lines. This
is a one-sheeted hyperboloid&mdash;a surface which is usually studied in
analytic geometry. There one learns that a one-sheeted hyperboloid
(henceforth referred to simply as a hyperboloid) is made up of lines&mdash;its
generatrices. Any two generatrices in the same family are skew, while any two
generatrices in different families are either parallel or intersect. We list some
other properties of hyperboloids which we shall need:
    (1) if a line has three points in common with a hyperboloid, then it is a
generatrix;
    (2) a plane containing a generatrix of a hyperboloid intersects the
hyperboloid in two generatrices;
    (3) there is a hyperboloid passing through any three pairwise skew lines
which do not lie in parallel planes. </p>
    <p> These properties are simple consequences of the fact that a hyperboloid
is a surface of degree two. Of course, one could describe all of this without
appealing to analytic geometry, using the same language as the ancient Greeks,
but we shall not try the reader's patience by proceeding in that way. </p>
    <p> Thus, in order to complete the isotopy classification of four-tuples of
lines, we shall prove that any interlacing of four lines is isotopic to one of the
interlacings in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')"
class="cp2recto">20</span>. We take an arbitrary interlacing of four lines.
By moving it slightly, if necessary, we can obtain a situation where three of the
four lines (it makes no difference which three) do not lie in parallel planes. We
construct a hyperboloid through these three lines, and we observe how the
fourth line is situated relative to the hyperboloid. There are four possibilities:
    (a) the line does not intersect the hyperboloid;
    (b) the line intersects the hyperboloid in a single point;
    (c) the line intersects the hyperboloid in two points;
    (d) the line lies on the hyperboloid. </p>
    <p> In case (d) the interlacing of four lines consists of four generatrices of
the hyperboloid, and is obviously isotopic to the left or the center interlacing


in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')" class="cp2recto">20</span>.
</p>
   <p> If the fourth line does not intersect the hyperboloid, then it can be
brought in toward the hyperboloid until it is tangent to the hyperboloid, i.e.,
the first case can easily be reduced to case (b). </p>
   <p> Case (b), in turn, reduces to either (c) or (d). To see this, we draw a
generatrix $ l$ through the point of intersection of the hyperboloid
with the fourth line, where $ l$ is taken in the same family of
generatrices as the first three lines of the interlacing. By property (3), the
plane $ a$ containing $ l$ and the fourth line intersects the
hyperboloid in two generatrices $ l$ and $ l'$. If
$ l'$ intersects $ l$ and the fourth line in the same point,
then, rotating the fourth line around this point of intersection in the plane
$ a$ until it coincides with $ l$, we find ourselves in case (d)
(Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f25')" class="cp2recto">21</span>(a)).
Otherwise, the fourth line of the interlacing is parallel to $ l'$ (if this
weren't the case we would have case (c)) (see Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f25')" class="cp2recto">21</span>(b)). But if we
perform a small rotation toward the fourth line around the intersection point
with $ l$ in the plane $ a$, we see that the fourth line is no
longer parallel to $ l'$: it intersects $ l'$, and hence it
intersects the hyperboloid in two points, giving us case (c). </p>
   <p> Now if the fourth line intersects the hyperboloid in two pints, then
everything depends on whether these points are in the same part of the
hyperboloid into which the first three lines divide it, or are in different parts
(the hyperboloid is divided into three sections). If they are in the same part,
then the fourth line can be placed on the hyperboloid without the first three
lines interfering. Then the fourth line becomes a generatrix, and we are in case
(d). If the fourth line intersects the hyperboloid in different parts, then the
interlacing is isotopic to the right interlacing in Figure <span

   <p> The next step&mdash;the classification of interlacings of five
lines&mdash;requires a more careful study of the inner structure of
interlacings. The reader has undoubtedly noticed the striking difference
between amphicheiral and nonamphicheiral interlacings&mdash;compare the
sets of lines in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')"
class="cp2recto">20</span>. The left and the center interlacings both have


the feature that any line of the interlacing can be taken to any other line by
means of an isotopy. This is not the case for a amphicheiral interlacing (the
right one in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')"
class="cp2recto">20</span>). We shall say that two lines of an interlacing
are <span class="emph" > isotopic </span>
if there exists an isotopy of the interlacing which takes one of the lines to the
other one. To be sure, strictly speaking this is not an isotopy, because at the
last moment the two lines come together. Instead of changing the meaning of
the word "isotopy", we are better off leaving the meaning unchanged and
adopting the following definition of isotopic lines of an interlacing: there is an
isotopy of the entire interlacing which makes the two lines approach one
another so that one can separate them from the other lines of the interlacing
by a hyperboloid (in which case there is nothing to stop us from bringing the
two lines together). </p>
    <p> Isotopic lines have the same location relative to the other lines in the
interlacing. Hence, if $ a$ and $ b$ are isotopic lines and
$ c$ and $ d$ are two other lines of the same interlacing, then
the triples $ a,c,d$ and $ b,c,d$ have the same linking number.
Using this necessary condition for lines to be isotopic, we can easily show that
in the interlacing on the right in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')"
class="cp2recto">20</span> the line $ l$ is not isotopic to
$ m$. In fact, the triple $ l,n,k$ has linking number $ +1$,
while the triple $ m,n,k$ has linking number $ -1$. </p>
    <p> It is clear that, <span class="emph" > given any two isotopic lines
in an interlacing, an isotopy can be found which interchanges them and causes
all of the other lines to end up in the same place as before. </span>
Hence, isotopy of lines in an interfacing is an equivalence relation, and the
set of all lines in an interfacing is partitioned into isotopy equivalence classes.
The left and center interlacings in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')"
class="cp2recto">20</span> each has only one equivalence class, while the
right interlacing has two: the lines $ k$ and $ l$ are in one
class, and $ m$ and $ n$ are in another. </p>
    <p> If we choose one line from each equivalence class in an interlacing, then
the isotopy type of the resulting interlacing does not depend on our choice of a
line in each equivalence class. This interlacing is called the <span class="emph"
> derived interlacing </span>
. </p>
    <p> It is useful to pass to the derived interlacing if it contains fewer lines
than the original interlacing. In order to recover the original interlacing from
the derived one, one needs a relatively small amount of additional information,
namely, how many lines were in each class and how they were linked to one
another.

   <p> We leave it as an exercise to construct an isotopy that does this. </p>
   <p> The derived interlacing determines the relative location of the

of the two families of generatrices on each hyperboloid. Here one does not
have to do this at all if the class has only one line or if there is only one class

   <p> A class of isotropic lines of an interlacing whose invariant is
$ \vare$ $ (=\pm1)$ will be called an $ \vare$- <span
class="FontItalic" > class </span>
. </p>
   <p> Some interlacings can be brought to the form of an interlacing of one
line by successively taking the derived interlacing. Such an interlacing is said
to be <span class="emph" > completely decomposable </span>
. A completely decomposable interlacing can be characterized up to isotopy by
the invariants associated with each transition from an interlacing to its derived
interlacing. We shall introduce some notation for this characterization. An
interlacing of $ p$ generatrices of a hyperboloid which form an
$ \vare$-class of isotopic lines will be denoted by $ \lan\vare p\ran$. </p>
   <p> We now consider $ p$ hyperboloids which encompass
disjoint regions and which have the lines of the interlacing $ \lan\vare p\ran$ as
their axes. An interlacing made up of $ p$ subinterlacings
$ A_1,\dotsc,A_p$, each of which is in the region bounded by the corresponding
hyperboloid, will be denoted by $ \lan+A_1,\dotsc,A_p\ran$ if $ \vare=+1$ and
$ \lan-A_1,\dotsc,A_p\ran$ if $ \vare=-1$. In situations where the signs do not matter to
us, we shall omit them from the notation. For example, the interlacings in
Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f24')" class="cp2recto">20</span> are
characterized by the symbols $ \lan+4\ran$, $ \lan-4\ran$, and
$ \lan\lan+2\ran,\lan-2\ran\ran$. The interlacings in Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f16')"
class="cp2recto">14</span> are given by the symbols $ \lan+4\ran,\lan+5\ran,\lan+6\ran$. The
amphicheiral interlacing of an even number $ p$ of lines that was
constructed above is given by $ \lan\lan+p/2\ran,\lan-p/2\ran\ran$. In particular, the interlacing in
Figure <span onclick="Cp2Recto('f17')" class="cp2recto">??</span> is
$ \lan\lan+2\ran,\lan-2\ran\ran$. </p>
   <p> Not every interlacing is completely decomposable. For example, the
derived interlacing for the interlacing in Figure <span
onclick="Cp2Recto('f19')" class="cp2recto">16</span> coincides with the
original interlacing, and it cannot be placed on a hyperboloid (otherwise it
would not be an amphicheiral interlacing). This is the simplest example of an
interlacing which is not completely decomposable.

really distinct one has to perform computer calculations of more complicated
invariants of the interlacings. Before describing Mazurovskii&#774;'s basic


results in more detail, we give some definitions. </p>
    <p> We shall need a construction proposed by Mazurovskii&#774; to

the line's orientation. Now, given a permutation $ \si$ of
$ \{1,\dotsc,k\}$, we construct an interlacing of $ k$ lines by joining
$ A_i$ to $ B_{\si(i)}$. Following Mazurovskii&#774;, we shall
denote this interlacing of the $ k$ lines $ A_1B_{\si(1)},\dotsc,A_kB_{\si(k)}$ by the symbol
$ jc(\si)$. Interlacings which are isotopic to an interlacing constructed in

$ M'$ and $ L'$. Here $ M$ and its mirror image
$ M'$ cannot be distinguished by means of the linking numbers of the
triples in the interlacings. But they can be distinguished using Drobotukhina's
polynomial invariant, which for $ M$ is equal to  \begin{align*} -A^{15}+6&A^{11}+6A^9-5A^7-6A^5+10A^3+16A\\ +&A^{-1}-10A^{-3}+10A^{-7}+5A^{-9},\end{align*} and for

distinguished from the interlacing $ jc(1,2,5,6,3,4)$ by means of the linking
numbers, but these two interlacings do have different polynomial invariants:
for $ L$ it is  \begin{align*} A^{17}-5A^{13}&+15A^{9}+10A^{7}-13A^{5}-12A^{3}+15A\\ &+22A^{-1}-A^{-3}-12A^{-5}+A^{-7}+8A^{-9}+3A^{-11}\end{align*} and for $ jc(1,2,5,6,3,4)$ it is  \begin{equation*}A^{13}+A^{11}+4A^{7}+7A^{5}+3A^{3}+2A^{-1}+5A^{-3}+3A^{-5} +2A^{-9}+3A^{-11}+A^{-13}.\end{equation*}
</p>
   <p> The derived interlacing of $ L$ coincides with $ L$
itself. The same holds for the mirror image $ L'$ of $ L$,
the interlacings $ M$ and $ M'$, and also the amphicheiral
interlacing $ jc(1,3,5,2,6,4)$. The interlacings $ jc(1,2,4,6,3,5)$ and $ jc(5,3,6,4,2,1)$
(which are mirror images of one another) both have the same derived
interlacing, namely, an amphicheiral interlacing of five lines (which coincides
with its own derived interlacing). The remaining types of interlacings of six
lines are completely decomposable. Of those 12 types, two are the
amphicheiral interlacings  \begin{equation*}\lan\lan+3\ran,\lan-3\ran\ran=jc(1,2,3,6,5,4)\end{equation*} and  \begin{equation*}\lan\lan-\lan1\ran, \lan+2\ran\ran,\lan+\lan1\ran,\lan-2\ran\ran\ran=jc(1,2,4,6,5,3),\end{equation*} and the ten others can
be divided into pairs of nonamphicheiral interlacings, each pair consisting of
an interlacing and its mirror image:  \begin{equation*}\lan-6\ran=jc(1,2,3,4,5,6),\qquad\lan+6\ran=jc(6,5,4,3,2,1);\end{equation*}

to a plane onto extensions of sides of a convex polygon with seven sides, and
the lines can be ordered in such a way that the line with number $ i$
passes over all the lines whose numbers are greater than $ i$. In other
words, the first line lies over all the other lines, the second one passes over all
the lines besides the first one, the third line passes over all lines with numbers
greater than three, etc.

of unordered interlacings do not split when we take into account an order of
lines. So there are exactly two isotopy classes of ordered interlacings of 4 lines.
In an amphicheiral interlacing of 4 lines, the lines are divided into two pairs of
isotopic lines, $ +1$-class and $ -1$-class. Lines of the same
class can be transposed by a isotopy, while the lines of different classes cannot.
Denote the lines of the $ +1$-class by $ A$ and the lines of

$ AABB$, $ BBAA$, $ ABAB$, $ BABA$, $ BAAB$,
$ ABBA$. Together with the 2 classes of non-amphicheiral interlacings

   <p> We return to the definition of an interlacing of lines. We used this term
to denote a finite set of pairwise skew lines in three-dimensional space. That is,
among all possible sets of lines, we look at sets in general position which form


an everywhere dense open subset of the space of all sets of lines. </p>
    <p> The same can be done with other types of configurations. For
example, we can consider finite sets of points in three-dimensional space. We

if for $ k\le 4$ there is no set of $ k$ points lying in a
$ (k-2)$-dimensional subspace (i.e., a four-tuple does not lie in a plane, a

a set we mean a motion in the course of which these conditions are not
violated. We say that a nonsingular set of points is <span class="FontItalic"

if it is isotopic to its mirror image. </p>
    <p> We shall not treat the problem of classifying nonsingular sets of points,

Given a nonsingular set of points, we define $ s$ to be the sum of
the linking numbers of all triples of pairwise skew lines determined by pairs of
points in our set. If our set has $ q$ points, then the number of such
triples is $ \frac16\binom{q}{2}\binom{q-2}{2}\binom{q-4}{2}$. If $ q\equiv 6$ or $ 7\mod8$, then this number is
odd, and so $ s$ is also odd, since it is a sum of an odd number of
terms each of which is $ \pm1$. Clearly, $ s$ is preserved
under isotopies of the set of points, and it is multiplied by $ -1$ under
mirror reflection. Hence, $ s=0$ for an amphicheiral set. We conclude
that if $ q\equiv 6$ or $ 7\mod8$, a nonsingular set of $ q$
points cannot be amphicheiral. To treat the case $ q\equiv 3\mod8$,
$ q\ge11$, we introduce another numerical invariant of a nonsingular set
of points. We first note that, given any two points $ A$ and
$ B$ of our configuration, one can determine two opposite cyclic
orderings of the remaining $ q-2$ points, namely, the order in which a
plane rotating around the axis $ AB$ passes through them. If a triple
of lines consists of the line $ AB$ along with two lines joining four
successive points in this ordering (more precisely, one line joins the first point
to the second and the other one joins the third point to the fourth), then we
say that the triple is <span class="FontItalic" > cyclic </span>
. Our numerical invariant of a nonsingular set of points will then be the sum
of the linking numbers of all cyclic triples of lines with distinguished first line.
If $ q\ge7$, then there are $ (q-2)\binom{q}{2}$ terms in this sum, and so the
sum is odd if $ q\equiv 3\mod4$, $ q\ge7$. On the other hand, the sum is
clearly equal to zero if we have an amphicheiral set. <span

   <p> It is natural to ask questions about amphicheirality for nonsingular
sets of points which are analogous to the four questions discussed above in
connection with amphicheiral interlacings of lines. We do not know complete
answers to those questions. </p>
   <p> In the same spirit one can consider a mixed situation: configurations
of both lines and points. There are various ways of defining a nonsingular
configuration of this type, but the most natural definition is to require that the
lines in the configuration be pairwise skew, the points not lie on the lines, and
no two points lie in a common plane with one of the lines. Even less is known
about the classification and amphicheirality of mixed configurations. </p>
   <p> When investigating problems related to geometrical objects in
Euclidean space, it is often useful to extend the space to a projective space.
Projective space has even been called the "great simplifier". Passing to a
projective space normally enables us to find a simpler projective classification
problem inside our original classification problem, and this projective problem
is usually interesting in its own right. The case of interlacings of lines is,
however, an exception to this rule. When one goes from $ \R^3$ to the
projective space $ \R P^3$, an interlacing of lines corresponds to a set of
disjoint projective lines, and in this way one obtains all possible configurations
of disjoint lines in $ \R P^3$ in which no line is contained in the plane at
infinity. Isotopy of interlacings is equivalent to the existence of an isotopy
between the corresponding configurations of lines in $ \R P^3$ in the
course of which the lines remain disjoint. <span id="footnote1"

    <p> Even in the case of interlacings of lines, passing to $ \R P^3$ is
not completely pointless. In $ \R P^3$ we can see more clearly the
topological reasons why interlacings are nonisotopic. As we showed at the very
beginning of the article, any interlacing can be deformed into a set of parallel
lines, and so there exists a homeomorphisms of $ \R^3$ under which any
interlacing is taken to any other given interlacing with the same number of
lines. In $ \R P^3$ this is no longer the case. The linking number
introduced above for oriented skew lines can be interpreted in terms of the
usual linking number in algebraic topology, applied to the corresponding lines
in $ \R P^3$ (except that we must double the topological invariant, which
takes the values $ \pm1/2$, since for us the values $ \pm1$ are more


convenient). Moreover, in all cases we know of, the nonisotopy of two
interlacings of lines is proved using topological invariants of the corresponding
sets of projective lines in $ \R P^3$, although there probably exist
nonisotopic interlacings of lines for which the corresponding sets of projective
lines can be taken to one another by means of a homeomorphism of the
ambient space. </p>
    <p> Perhaps we should show greater caution and make our definitions in
accordance with the accepted topological terminology, i.e., call interlacings of
lines isotopic if the corresponding sets of projective lines can be taken into
one another by a homeomorphism of $ \R P^3$ which is isotopic to the
identity (recall that an isotopy of the homeomorphism $ h\colon X\to Y$ is a family
of homeomorphisms $ h_t\colon X\to Y$ with $ t\in[0,1]$, $ h_0=h$, such that
the map $ X\times[0,1]\to Y\colon(x,t)\mapsto h_t(x)$ is continuous). Then what we earlier called isotopies
would be called <span class="FontItalic" > rigid isotopies </span>
. Our cavalier attitude about this is permissible only because at the present
level of knowledge we do not have examples of interlacings which show that
these two types of isotopies actually lead to different equivalence relations. In
some related situations, however, we do know such examples. We now discuss
one such case.

    <p> At first glance it might seem that the world of configurations of lines in
a plane resembles the world of configurations of lines in three-dimensional space,
which we made an attempt to understand above. It is certainly easy to give
definitions for plane configurations which are analogous to the basic definitions
in this article. But, contrary to our expectations, these two worlds have very
little in common. </p>
    <p> Undoubtedly, the plane configuration analog of an interlacing of skew
lines is a configuration of lines no three of which pass through a point and no
two of which are parallel. The analog of an isotopy of interlacings is a motion
during which the lines remain lines and the conditions on the location of the
lines are preserved. </p>
    <p> Passing from the plane to the projective plane changes the problem,
and here, as usual, the projective problem turns out to be simpler and more
elegant. In the projective problem the objects are sets of projective lines in
$ \R P^3$ which satisfy only one condition: no three of them pass through
a point. Such a projective plane configuration of lines will be said to be <span
class="FontItalic" > nonsingular </span>


. A configuration of this type can also be interpreted as a set of planes through
the origin in $ \R^3$ such that no three of them contain a line. </p>
    <p> In the case of nonsingular plane configurations of lines one must
distinguish between isotopies and rigid isotopies. Two configurations are
isotopic, or, equivalently, they have the same topological type, if one can be
taken to the other by means of a homeomorphism $ \R P^2\to\R P^2$. Two
configurations are said to be rigidly isotopic if they can be connected by a path
in space whose points are nonsingular plane configurations of lines. </p>
    <p> In the isotopic and rigid isotopic classification problems for plane
configurations we do not have the amphicheirality question. This is because
the mirror image of any configuration is isotopic to the original configuration,
since a reflection of the projective plane is isotopic to the identity map by
means of an isotopy consisting of projective transformations. (More generally,
the group of projective transformations of $ \R P^2$ is connected.) </p>
    <p> The isotopic and rigid isotopic classification problems for nonsingular
plane configurations of lines have both been solved for configurations where
the number of lines is $ \le7$, and in these cases the answer to both
problems turns out to be the same (see Finashin <span
id="cItE20[Finashin1988]" class="citeUp hide uidraggable" ></span><span
onclick="citeUp('shadebib.Finashin1988','cItE20[Finashin1988]')"
class="versolk">[Finashin1988]</span>). If there are $ \le5$ lines,
the isotopy type is determined by the number of lines. There are four types of
nonsingular plane configurations of six lines, and 11 types of nonsingular plane
configurations of seven lines. But when we reach configurations of more than
seven lines, the isotopy and rigid isotopy classifications diverge sharply. Mnev
<span id="cItE21[Mnev1988]" class="citeUp hide uidraggable"
></span><span
onclick="citeUp('shadebib.Mnev1988','cItE21[Mnev1988]')"
class="versolk">[Mnev1988]</span> proved a surprising theorem, according
to which, roughly speaking, a set of nonsingular plane configurations of lines
which are isotopic to one another can have the homotopy type of any affine
open semi-algebraic set, and, in particular, it can have any number of
connected components, i.e., it can contain an arbitrary number of rigid isotopy
classes. (This statement is imprecise, because in Mnev's work one considers
ordered configurations in which the first four lines are in a fixed position;
otherwise one must divide out by the action of the group of projective
transformations.) </p>
    <p> The simplest example known of nonsingular plane configurations of
lines which are isotopic but not rigid isotopic can be found in Suvorov <span

   <p> Thus, the theory of nonsingular plane configurations of lines is quite
different from the theory of interlacings of lines. This closely corresponds to
the picture one sees in the topology of manifolds: it is known that the topology
of manifolds of successive dimensions has far fewer common features than the
topology of manifolds whose dimensions differ by 4. </p>
   <p> In the topology of high-dimensional manifolds one even has precise
constructions which embed various parts of $ n$-dimensional topology
in $ (n+4)$-dimensional topology. In surgery theory this construction is
multiplication by a complex projective plane; in knot theory it is the two-fold
covering of Bredon; and in the theory of singularities it is the addition to our
function of the sum of the squares of two new variables. </p>
   <p> It seems that something similar occurs in the theory of projective
configurations. Interlacings of skew lines in three-dimensional space appear to
be related to configurations of pairwise skew $ (2k-1)$-dimensional
subspaces in $ (4k-1)$-dimensional space. One can define a linking
number for oriented skew $ (2k-1)$-dimensional subspaces of
$ (4k-1)$-dimensional space. Hence, all of the results on nonamphiheiral
interlacings that were proved using linking numbers carry over to this
multidimensional setting. </p>
   <p> Moreover, there is a simple construction which to any such
configuration associates a configuration of the same type with $ k$
increased by 1. This construction preserves the linking numbers, isotopic
configurations are taken to isotopic configurations, and perhaps to some extent
one has an embedding of the theory of configurations of
$ (2k-1)$-dimensional subspaces of $ (4k-1)$-dimensional space in
the theory of configurations of $ (2k+1)$-dimensional subspaces of
$ (4k+3)$-dimensional space. This gives rise to the possible development
of a stable theory of projective configurations.
   </p>
   <p> Here we shall give a description of this construction. As far as we
know, it has not been published prior to the second version <span

a suspension is applicable not only to configurations of
$ (2k-1)$-dimensional subspaces of $ (4k-1)$-dimensional space. It
applies to any configuration of finitely many subspaces in projective space; it
increases the subspace dimension by 2 and the ambient space dimension by 4.
</p>
    <p> We first recall the construction of the join of ordered configurations.
Let $ L_1$, ..., $ L_r$ be subspaces of $ \R P^p$, and let
$ M_1,\dotsc,M_r$ be subspaces of $ \R P^q$. We imbed $ \R P^p$ and
$ \R P^q$ in $ \R  P^{p+q+1}$ as skew subspaces. In the case of odd
$ p$ and $ q$ the imbeddings should be chosen with care
about orientations: the images, with their native orientations, should have
positive linking numbers in $ \R P^{p+q+1}$. Let $ K_1,\dotsc,K_r$ denote the
subspaces of $ \R P^{p+q+1}$ such that $ K_i$ is the union of all lines
which intersect $ L_i$ and $ M_i$. We call the configuration of
subspaces $ K_1,\dotsc,K_r$ the <span class="FontItalic" > join </span>
of our two configurations. <span id="footnote3" class="citeUp

    <p> By the <span class="FontItalic" > suspension </span>
of an arbitrary configuration $ L_1,\dotsc,L_r$ of subspaces of $ \R P^p$ we
mean its join with a configuration of $ r$ generatrices of a
(one-sheeted) hyperboloid in $ \R P^3$ with positive linking number (i.e.,
its join with the configuration of lines in $ \R  P^3$ corresponding to the
interlacing which we denoted by $ \lan+r\ran)$. Since any two lines of the
interlacing $ \lan+r\ran$ are isotropic, it follows that one can find an isotopy
of this interlacing which permutes the lines in an arbitrary way. Hence, the
join with an ordered configuration of subspaces $ L_1,\dotsc,L_r$ in $ \R P^p$
does not depend on the order. Thus, the suspension is well defined (up to rigid
isotopy) for unordered configurations. </p>

   <p> Almost everything in the first two-thirds of the article concerning
interlacings of lines, as well as everything concerning nonsingular sets of points
in three-dimensional space, was published by Viro in 1985 in the note <span
id="cItE30[Viro1985]" class="citeUp hide uidraggable" ></span><span
onclick="citeUp('shadebib.Viro1985','cItE30[Viro1985]')"
class="versolk">[Viro1985]</span>. Interest in this subject was stimulated
by work of Kharlamov on the classification of nonsingular real projective
algebraic surfaces of degree 4 up to rigid isotopy (by which one means
isotopies consisting of nonsingular algebraic surfaces). Earlier, a coarser
classification of such surfaces up to mirror reflections and rigid isotopies was
found by Nikulin <span id="cItE31[Nikulin1979]" class="citeUp hide
uidraggable" ></span><span
onclick="citeUp('shadebib.Nikulin1979','cItE31[Nikulin1979]')"
class="versolk">[Nikulin1979]</span>; and Kharlamov, using a very
complicated technique which involved passing to the complex domain, proved
that certain surfaces are nonamphiheiral, in the sense that they are not rigid
isotopic to their mirror images. It would be worthwhile to find an elementary
proof. </p>
   <p> Some of these surfaces decompose in the ambient three-dimensional
space into a one-sheeted hyperboloid with handles and a number of separate
spheres (the sum of the number of handles and the number of spheres is at
most ten, and there are other restrictions, but we shall not dwell on this).
From Harnack's theorem on the number of components of a plane curve it
follows that every plane intersects at most three of the spheres of this surface.
Hence, if we choose one point on each sphere, we obtain a nonsingular set of
points whose isotopy type is determined by the surface, and a rigid isotopy of


the surface corresponds to an isotopy of the set of points. Thus, if there are six
or seven spheres, the surface must be nonamphiheiral. In a similar way
Kharlamov proved that many other degree 4 surfaces are nonamphiheiral and
completed the classification of nonsingular surfaces of degree 4 (see <span

onclick="citeUp('shadebib.Kharlamov1988','cItE32[Kharlamov1988]')"

that certain of the surfaces are nonamphiheiral only by passing to the complex
domain and using the full theory of K3-surfaces.
